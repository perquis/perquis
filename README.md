# Hi there! :raised_hand:

My name is **Damian** and I'm going to become a **Front-end Developer**. My **biggest dream** is to make applications which **conquer the world**. Since childhood, I've dreamt about my company which will be innovative. Currently, I don't have a name in mind or what it will be dealing with. However, I know my dreams are very ambitious and I need to improve my skills and qualifications. **I try to get better every day** and I hope this dream will come true. I love learning new things. **I'm curious about all frameworks and libraries** created by languages of programming. These tools give developers the opportunity **to develop and deploy** their applications. Computer programming is my hobby. It gives me **power of creation something strange, mysterious, and interesting**.

I use **HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript every day**. These languages are **very useful and give me a lot of happiness**. I know to accomplish my dreams, I have to learn a lot of other languages and I have to get a tremendous knowledge of the programming, economics and life. In the future, I will learn another languages like Python, C# and Java **to create more complex web applications**. I'm ready **to dedicate my all life to get better a developer, businessman and human**.
